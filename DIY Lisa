# Structure of "Lisa"

## Overview

**Lisa** is a mechanical question system that works with balls, drill holes, and a question card. The goal is to playfully determine whether certain elements, topics, or properties can "pass through" — meaning they answer the question correctly.

## Components

* **Top Plate**  
  A solid top plate with various drilled holes. These define fixed positions for the balls. Each ball symbolically represents an element (e.g., a property, color, topic, word, etc.).

* **Balls**  
  The balls are placed on the top plate. Depending on layout and size, there can be a few or many.

* **Safety/Test Plate**  
  Beneath the top plate is a removable plate that initially holds the balls in place.

* **Question Cards (with holes)**  
  Below that lies a card with specific drill holes representing individual "questions". The card only allows balls to pass through if the respective question is answered with “Yes”.

## How It Works

1. Balls are placed into the holes of the top plate.  
2. One or more question cards are inserted underneath.  
3. When the safety plate is removed, only those balls fall through that symbolically answer “Yes” to the question.  
4. All others remain on the plate.  
5. This allows targeted testing of which balls can pass through.  
6. Afterwards, the question cards can be pulled out in reverse to analyze the path of the balls.

## Possible Materials

* Wood (classic)  
* Plastic  
* 3D-printable versions for future DIY use

## Application Ideas

* Playful learning system  
* Self-tests (personality, knowledge, preferences)  
* Experimental category filter  
* Creative brainstorming tool  
* Cryptography

## Next Steps

* Create example sketches (help urgently needed)  
* Build instructions (PDF & 3D files)  
* Pick up prototypes and define DIN dimensions
