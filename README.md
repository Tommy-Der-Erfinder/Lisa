Project LISA – The Haptic Learning Tool with Surprising Side Effects

What is LISA?
LISA is a haptic learning tool — built mainly from wood — that feels like a bridge between simple mechanics and high-level information processing.
It's not a quantum computer... but surprisingly, it can already be used for tasks like cryptography, pattern recognition, and even reviving ancient languages.
It sounds unbelievable — even to me, the inventor — but it's real.

How does it work?
At its core, LISA consists of:

    A top plate where a selected topic is laid out.

    Balls (spheres) positioned at specific points representing answers or properties.

    Each ball's position is marked and can later be evaluated for test results.

    Security layers underneath ensure the process stays structured.

You introduce questions into the system, and the top-level balls answer them simultaneously — leading to immediate, grouped results and insights you might not expect.

Why Open Source?
I've used LISA for a long time in my private research without even realizing how unique and powerful it truly is — until I noticed that others didn't have access to anything like it.
This realization left me feeling responsible to share it with the world.
Education should be accessible to everyone — and LISA can break down complex knowledge into simple, tangible experiences.

With just a few wooden pieces and a handful of balls, you can:

    Understand complex connections

    Learn how to ask the right questions

    Memorize information faster and more sustainably

    Visually and physically "feel" group-based answers

Limitations and Opportunities:
I am not a professional engineer or developer.
There is still a lot of technical refinement possible — especially digitally and mechanically.
That's why I am looking for collaborators, makers, educators, and tech enthusiasts who want to help bring LISA to its full potential.

Milestones and Vision:

Basic physical prototype built

Open-source community launch (You are here!)

Digital tools/scripts to expand LISA's use

Workshops and educational programs based on LISA

    Exploring cryptographic and information theory applications
