# LISA

**A haptic open-source learning tool combining simplicity with the power of pattern recognition, cryptography, and ancient language revival.**

## What is LISA?

LISA is a tangible learning tool with unexpected side effects.  
While not a quantum computer, it gets surprisingly close:  
- It can be used for cryptography and encryption technology.
- It enables the revival of ancient languages.
- It helps people to understand complex systems and ask better questions.

Despite being made of simple materials like wood and marbles, LISA has shown tremendous power in pattern recognition and data structuring.

## How does LISA work?

The structure is simple yet profound:
- A top plate defines a chosen theme, with marbles placed on specific marked positions.
- Underneath, a **question layer** interacts with all marbles at once.
- A **security plate** ensures that results are protected and only valid interactions are considered.

By interpreting which marbles "survive" the testing questions, patterns and connections emerge that are often surprising and insightful.

## Why open source?

For years, LISA has been a private tool for personal exploration and learning.  
Only recently, I realized how essential it could be for broader education and research.  
Its simplicity makes it accessible to everyone â€” from schools to advanced cryptographers.

By sharing LISA as an open-source project, I hope to:
- Make education more tangible.
- Help people rediscover lost knowledge.
- Enable creative new methods for learning and research.

## My vision

LISA is just the beginning.  
There may be many more variations and improvements based on this simple yet powerful idea.

I'm inviting everyone to participate, experiment, and help LISA grow into the tool it was always meant to be.
